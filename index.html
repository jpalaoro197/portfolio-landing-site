      <h2>More about me and my background.</h2>
      <p>As far as education goes this is my first bit of class ive had in seven years. i used to be in a manufacturing and engineering program, which consisted of cnc programming, fabrication, welding, and manual machining. After my schooling I moved to Eugene for some fun, moved back to Portland a year later for a auditor job at Hyundai inspecting cars as they came into the port from South Korea. By the end of my time at Hyundai, I met my life partner and moved out to Maupin, OR to become a white water raft guide. Another year passes and we moved to Eugene where I became a lead at a custom fancy ceiling company. fast forward another year we had a kid and were heading back to Portland for a job at kroger, and 4 long years I landed myself here at epicodus starting a career that'll help me fulfill my family's goals! </p>
