      <h2>More about me and my background.</h2>
      <p>As far as education goes this is my first bit of class I've had in seven years. I used to be in a <span class="red">manufacturing and engineering program</span>, which consisted of cnc programming, fabrication, welding, and manual machining. After my schooling I moved to Eugene for <span class="red">some fun</span>, moved back to Portland a year later for an<span class="red"> auditor job at Hyundai</span> inspecting cars as they came into the port from South Korea. By the end of my time at Hyundai, I <span class="red">met my life partner</span> and moved out to Maupin, OR to become a white water <span class="red">raft guide</span>. Another year passes and we moved to Eugene where I <span class="red">became a lead at a custom fancy ceiling company</span>. fast forward another year we <span class="red">had a kid</span> and were heading back to Portland for a <span class="red">job at kroger</span>, and 4 long years I landed myself here at epicodus starting a career that'll help me fulfill my family's goals! </p>
